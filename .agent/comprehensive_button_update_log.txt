    -   All buttons now use `.btn-primary` and exist within a consistent card header structure.

2.  **System/Certificate Manager**:
    -   Standardized "Add CA" button.
    -   Standardized "Add/Sign Certificate" button.
    -   Standardized "Create CRL" button in the Revocation tab, adding a section title "Revocation Lists" for consistency.

3.  **System/Advanced**:
    -   Standardized "Add Tunable" button in the Tunables tab.

4.  **Interfaces**:
    -   Updated `interfaces/bridges/index.blade.php`: Added card header with title "Bridges" and standardized "Add Bridge" button.
    -   Updated `interfaces/gre/index.blade.php`: Added card header with title "GRE Tunnels" and standardized "Add GRE" button.
    -   Updated `interfaces/groups/index.blade.php`: Added card header with title "Interface Groups" and standardized "Add Group" button.
    -   Updated `interfaces/laggs/index.blade.php`: Added card header with title "LAGG Interfaces" and standardized "Add LAGG" button.

5.  **Services/DHCP**:
    -   Updated the "Save" button to use `.btn-primary` standard, replacing legacy `pf-btn` classes.

**Route Verification:**
-   Audited `routes/web.php` for `firewall/{firewall}/...` routes.
-   Confirmed that major sections (Firewall, VPN, Services, System, Interfaces) have been addressed.
-   Specific sub-pages like VLANs, NAT, IPsec, etc. were addressed in previous steps.

This ensures a widespread and consistent application of the new button styling and placement guidelines across the application's firewall management features.
